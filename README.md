# Crypto-Nerual-Network

Please go through the folliwng steps if you want to run the neural networks on crypto. 

## First Step: Get the Crypto Data from Binance
The file _Crypto_data_generator.ipynb_ contains the data that extract the dataset from the Binance exchange. You can pick
the timeframe (ex. '1m','5m', '1h', '1d', '30m') and the time period you want to test on. Also, you can select all the cryptos that
are currently being trading on the Binance.

## Second Step: Run the Codes
There are two files:
- _Neural_Network_crypto.ipynb_ this file willl only run the prediction of the neural network on the crypto you selected.
- _bitcoin_p.ipynb_ this file I create to run the neural network strategy to long and short the bitcoin.
